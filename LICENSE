License Fees are described in AnApp Blockchain’s standard price list, quote or Purchase Order confirmation, as the case may be.

The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or for any reason whatsoever.

8.2 Ordering Licenses

Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon, at AnApp Blockchain's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.

Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses to AnApp Blockchain by email or any other method acceptable to AnApp Blockchain (each such order is referred to herein as a “Purchase Order”) for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the Parties.

Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or integrating (all jointly “installing”) the Redistributables with the Devices or for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.

Each time Licensee “installs” or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee’s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.

Licensee may “install” copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.

In addition, if Licensee includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will not be deemed to have been “installed” and will not require an additional Distribution License. 

8.4 Payment Terms

License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from AnApp Blockchain.

AnApp Blockchain will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after AnApp Blockchain receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.

A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due.

AnApp Blockchian shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion. 

8.5 Taxes

Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of Licensee’s activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution of Redistributables.

Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities. AnApp Blockchain or the independent auditor acting on behalf of AnApp Blockchain shall be entitled to inspect Licensee’s Records. All such Licensee’s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.

If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay AnApp Blockchain any amounts owed for such unauthorized use. 

In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall indemnify AnApp Blockchain's cost of conducting such audit.
