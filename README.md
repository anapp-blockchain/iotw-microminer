# IOTW Micro-miner Pre-alpha Release

Help build IOT devices to operate on the IOTW Blockchain seamlessly.

## Introduction

IOTW is an IOT blockchain infrastructure using Proof of Assignment protocol that enables micro-mining on all connected devices and provides access to previously connected device to enable usage data for the development of both domestic and commercial applications. The project was launched in late 2018 with around 20 core team members. The goal of IOTW is to create a blockchain platform that connects IOT devices (or micro-miners), brings blockchain to every household industry and business.

The library for building micro-miners is now open sourced and can be used to create IOT device applications that communicate with the on-line IOTW Blockchain network and perform mining and various functions. 

## Deployment

We will add notes about how to deploy micro-miners on the IOTW Blockchain soon. Please stay tuned.
